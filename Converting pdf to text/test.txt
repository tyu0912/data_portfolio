The Board of Directors 
athenahealth, Inc. 
311 Arsenal Street 
Watertown, MA 02472 
 
Dear Members of the Board: 
 
I  am  writing  to  you  again  on  behalf  of  Elliott  Associates,  L.P.  and  Elliott  International,  L.P. 
(collectively, “Elliott” or “we”).   
 
First, we want to thank the Company for having its advisors reach out in response to our letter of 
May  14  and  inform  us  that  the  Board  is  discussing  our  $160  per  share  all-cash  offer  (the 
“Proposal”).    We  strongly  believe  that  the  Proposal  provides  compelling,  premium  value  for 
shareholders, and we are eager to engage in customary private due diligence, which may  allow 
us to substantially increase our offer. 
 
The purpose of this note is to share with you the reactions to our offer that we’ve seen and heard, 
both  privately  and  in  the  form  of  published  research  and  commentary.    As  is  typical  when  we 
make a public disclosure, we have received a significant volume of feedback from shareholders, 
and  we  have  seen  multiple  reports  analyzing  our  Proposal.    As  you  consider  the  best  path 
forward, we thought sharing some of this feedback would add value to your deliberations.   
 
Reactions  to  our  Proposal  fall  into  four  categories:  feedback  from  shareholders,  published 
research  by  equity  research  analysts,  a  survey  of  the  broader  investment  community  and 
comments  from  informed  media.    Regardless  of  the  source,  the  feedback  has  been 
overwhelmingly  supportive  of  the  idea  that  athenahealth  has  struggled  as  a  public 
company and should immediately and fully explore a value-maximizing sale. 
 
We have aggregated this feedback below, and we hope you find these perspectives useful as you 
carefully consider our Proposal.    
 
Shareholders Support Exploring a Sale Process 
 
Since  we  first  filed  our  13D  last  May,  we  have  received  feedback  from  athenahealth 
shareholders, both  new  and longstanding.  This  feedback has only intensified over the last  few 
weeks.  At this point, we have had dozens of conversations and have heard from  a majority of 
athenahealth’s shareholder base.  Feedback was varied and thoughtful, but primarily conformed 

 

1 

to  the  following  thoughts,  which  reflect  those  of  numerous  shareholders  representing  a 
significant portion of the base: 
 

  athenahealth should fully explore a sale process, including Elliott’s offer. 

 

  athenahealth should attempt to solicit the highest price possible for the Company. 

 

 

  Shareholders are frustrated by historical  execution and skeptical  of the Company’s plan 

and ability to execute in the future. 

  Shareholders  were  profoundly  upset  to  learn  of  the  Company’s  lack  of  engagement 
with  Elliott’s prior  efforts  to  start  a discussion about  a value-maximizing sale,  and they 
question the Board’s oversight of the Company as a result.   

 
Many of the Company’s largest shareholders have informed us that they have directly conveyed 
this  feedback  to  the  Board.    Last  Friday,  Janus  Henderson,  the  Company’s  largest 
shareholder  and an investor since athenahealth’s IPO  more than a decade ago,  also  came 
public  in  a  13D  filing  expressing  its  support  for  a  comprehensive  sale  process  and  its 
concern with the Company’s execution of “strategic initiatives.” We understand many other 
large shareholders have shared their thoughts privately with the Board.  
 
It is also important to emphasize that athenahealth’s stock price is now trading at $154 per share, 
an increase of 22% from the stock price prior to the public disclosure of Elliott’s offer.  Investors 
are  now  expecting  the  Company  to  engage  with  Elliott  and  other  interested  parties.    Failure  to 
engage will likely result in athenahealth’s stock returning to depressed levels. 
 
This  context  is  important  for  the  Board  to  keep  in  mind  when  evaluating  athenahealth’s  next 
steps.  athenahealth’s shareholders have spoken, and it is clear from their words and actions that 
rejecting  the  idea  of  evaluating  a  sale  and  instead  offering  assurances  that  the  Company  has  a 
standalone  plan  for  getting  back  on  track  will  not  be  accepted.  The  feedback  we’ve  received 
suggests that athenahealth would find shareholder patience for such promises exceedingly low. 
 
Equity Research Supports and Expects Pursuit of a Process 
 
Equity research analysts have generally followed athenahealth for years and talk frequently with 
their clients who are athenahealth shareholders and investors in the broader Healthcare IT space.  
Their views are shaped by years of institutional knowledge of athenahealth and its industry, and 
theirs are important voices that inform current and prospective shareholders.   
 
Elliott believes it has reviewed all of the research that has been published regarding our offer for 
the  Company.    From  this  review,  it  is  apparent  that  equity  research  analysts  overwhelmingly 
find  that  our  offer  represents  an  attractive  starting  proposition  for  shareholders  and  that 
athenahealth should fully consider it as well as other possible offers.  
 
The below comments are illustrative and echo many of the sentiments we heard repeatedly from 
shareholders (emphasis added throughout):

“We  fear  Athenahealth  could  be  facing  a  multi-year  turnaround  story,  as  nothing 
happens quickly in Healthcare IT. We believe current investors could be well served by 
endorsing  the  activist’s  $160/share  (or  better)  offer  for  Athenahealth  shares,  and  we 
view the take-private opportunity as an attractive exit. We do not doubt that Athena is a 
good  company  with  a  strong  product  offering;  however,  that  does  not  make  it  a  good 
stock for public market investors.” – RBC, May 17, 2018 
 
 “We believe the price Elliott offered is more than fair given the challenges that ATHN 
is facing.” – Cantor Fitzgerald, May 7, 2018 
 
“We  anticipate  that  shareholders  will  be  supportive  of  a  decision  to  accept  Elliott’s 
bid.” – Deutsche Bank, May 8, 2018 
 
“We  agree  with  Elliott  Management  that  going  private  is  in  the  best  interest  of  all 
stakeholders.  At  this  point  in  ATHN’s  life  cycle,  there  is  little  benefit  to  being  a  public 
company.” – Hedgeye Risk Management, May 7, 2018 
 
“Points made in the [Elliott] letter to  the board  align with our  investment  thesis, and 
we believe the acquisition could be compelling value to shareholders.” – Cowen, May 
7, 2018 
 
“It is our view that the acquisition proposal is well thought out, credible and should be 
accepted.” – Dougherty & Company LLC, May 7, 2018 
 
“The  proposed  acquisition  price  is  a  45%  premium  to  our  fair  value  estimate,  and  we 
believe 
for  current  Athenahealth 
shareholders,  especially  considering  it  is  an  all-cash  offer.  We  believe  there  is  a 
significantly high probability that Athenahealth’s board and shareholders will approve 
the acquisition.  Accordingly, we are increasing our fair value estimate to $160 to reflect 
Elliott’s offer price and its likely approval by shareholders.” – Morningstar, May 7, 2018 
 
“Elliott…has  significant  private  equity  experience,  particularly  in  recent  years  in  the 
technology sector with go-private deals including BMC Software and Gigamon. Elliott 
may  also  gain  support  from  fellow  shareholders  and,  more  importantly,  the  board  of 
directors  for  the  criticisms  raised  in  its  proposal  letter  including  significant  recent 
executive turnover, the stalled nature of the search for an operational-focused president, 
and execution around the recent cost reduction plan.” – William Blair, May 7, 2018 
 
“We  believe  several  shareholders  will  agree  that  the  pace  of  change  has  been 
frustrating.” – Stifel, May 7, 2018 
 
“We  don't  think  Elliot  will  easily  back  down  and  suspect  other  shareholders  would,  at 
the very least, support the exploration of a sale process.” – Baird, May 8, 2018 
 
“The  findings  of  our  fundamental  analysis  –  acute  contributions  will  fall  short  of 
expectations  –  is  another  indicator  that  valuation  remains  ahead  of  near-term 
fundamentals.  Given  this  fundamental  outlook  and  our  view  that  ATHN’s  value  lies 

it  represents  a  highly 

lucrative  opportunity

beyond 2020, which is to say beyond the majority of public market investor time horizons, 
we  believe  Elliot’s  offer  is  compelling  and  so  are  optimistic  that  it  will  serve  as  a 
catalyst  for  athena  to  embrace  strategic  alternatives.”  –  Nephron  Research,  May  18, 
2018 
 
“We  are  using  our  proprietary  investor  survey  to  risk-weight  our  PT,  which  is  now 
increased  to  $165.  This  equates  to  a  25%  chance  of  ATHN  remaining  standalone  (our 
unaffected PT was $151), a 45% chance of ATHN being acquired for cash at $160 and 
a 30% chance of ATHN being acquired by a strategic (we assume value of ~$175 based 
on  historical  software  /  HIT  transaction  comps  of  4.5-5x  forward  Rev,  17.5x  forward 
EBITDA and 25x forward OCF).” – Evercore, May 8, 2018 

 
Investors Surveyed by Evercore ISI Research See a Sale 
 
Evercore ISI Research customarily conducts surveys of the investment community in response to 
M&A  announcements.    In  its  survey  following  our  Proposal,  to  which  ~100  members  of  the 
investment  community  responded,  the  feedback  was  overwhelming:    Investors  think  the 
Company  will,  and  should,  explore  a  sale.    In  fact,  the  athenahealth  shareholders  that 
responded unanimously  think the outcome of our bid will end with  an acquisition  by Elliott or 
another buyer.  The findings of the survey are well summarized by Evercore below: 
 

“We recently conducted an investor survey that in our minds produced very compelling 
results.  Both  the  average  investor  +  shareholders  favored  pursuing  strategic  action  vs. 
the  standalone  option  by  a  wide  margin.  Even  more  interesting,  not  one  of  the 
shareholders  who  participated  believe  ATHN  will  end  up  a  standalone  company  (we 
find this remarkable). In our mind this is a major shift in view versus 12mo ago, as our 
sense when Elliott initially filed was that long-term investors wanted to give management 
the benefit of the doubt and allow them to pursue self-help. Our read is that patience has 
worn out and in the event there is a strategic that would approach in the range of $170 
they  would  be  open  to  selling  the  equity.  We  cannot  ignore  such  a  seismic  shift  and 
neither in our mind can the BoD.” – Evercore, May 8, 2018 
 

The “comments  for ATHN’s management” section of the survey  was just as compelling as the 
survey  results:    Nearly  90%  of  the  comments  seemingly  included  some  variant  of  the 
message  that  the  Company  should  either  take  the  Elliott  offer  or  explore  an  alternative 
value-maximizing transaction.  
 
Informed Media Say a Rejection of our Offer Would Anger Shareholders 
 
Multiple informed media commentators also reacted positively to our Proposal, emphasizing that 
a  rejection  of  the  Proposal  would  further  frustrate  shareholders.    These  commentators  agreed 
that,  in  light  of  athenahealth’s  ongoing  underperformance  and  execution  issues,  it  is  in  the 
Company’s best interest to consider our offer. Some examples include: 

 
“Whether  or  not  Elliott  ends  up  being  the  eventual  buyer,  Bush  would  be  wise  to 
capitalize on the opportunity and exit the public market.” – Bloomberg Opinion, May 7, 
2018

“Despite their loyalty, institutional investors will not stick with the company if it rejects 
Elliott’s advances outright.” – FT Lex, May 7, 2018 
  
“[Elliott’s bid] could inspire a rival software firm, or perhaps an insurer in the rapidly 
consolidating  U.S.  healthcare  industry,  to  jump  in.”  –  Reuters  Breakingviews,  May  7, 
2018 
 
“The push from the company’s top investor draws a line in the sand, potentially forcing 
the  company’s  top  shareholders  to  take  a  stance  on  the  proposed  acquisition.”  – 
FierceHealthcare, May 21, 2018 
 
“The company has not publicly acknowledged JHG’s [Janus] statement, but the fact it’s 
coming  from  the  top  shareholder  could  force  the  board  to  seriously  consider  Elliott’s 
proposal or others that might come its way.” – Healthcare Dive, May 23, 2018 

 
Next Steps 
 
We believe the consistent support our Proposal has received from shareholders, equity research 
analysts, the broader investment community and informed media represents a consensus that the 
Board  simply  cannot  ignore.    We  understand  other  shareholders  and  stakeholders  have  shared 
similar feedback with you. 
 
In addition, we are aware that other parties have expressed interest in participating in a sale 
process.  While  we  think  our  Proposal  at  $160  per  share  represents  premium  value  for 
shareholders, shareholders and analysts have made clear in their communications to us that they 
believe that the Board has a fiduciary duty to engage with all other credible, interested parties in 
order to maximize value for shareholders.  
  
Based  upon  the  feedback  to  date,  we  think  the  best  next  step  would  be  for  the  Company  to 
authorize its advisors to immediately initiate a sale process, in which Elliott will participate 
as  a  bidder.    We  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to  engage  in  further  discussions  about  our 
offer with  Jonathan, Jeff and the rest  of the  Board.   We  are prepared to  meet  anytime,  and  we 
will make ourselves available at your convenience. Again, we strongly believe that going private 
gives athenahealth the best chance to thrive as a disruptor in the healthcare technology market.   
 
Thank you for considering our offer.  As always, I am happy to answer any further questions you 
may have. 
 
Best regards,
